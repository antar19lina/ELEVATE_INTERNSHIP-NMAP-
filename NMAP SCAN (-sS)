# 🔍Identify Potential Security Risks

This section outlines the potential security risks associated with each of the open ports discovered during the scan. It also includes practical mitigation recommendations.

---

## 🔸 Port **135/tcp** — `msrpc`

- **🧠 Description:** Microsoft Remote Procedure Call (RPC) used for remote management, WMI, and DCOM services.
- **⚠️ Risks:**
  - Enables **remote code execution** via DCOM vulnerabilities.
  - Can be used for **lateral movement** inside Windows networks.
  - Targeted in worms like **Blaster** and tools like **Metasploit**.
- **✅ Recommendations:**
  - Block this port on external interfaces.
  - Restrict WMI and RPC usage to **trusted subnets**.
  - Enforce **strong authentication** and **least privilege** for RPC use.

---

## 🔸 Port **139/tcp** — `netbios-ssn`

- **🧠 Description:** NetBIOS Session Service, mainly used for Windows file/printer sharing (legacy).
- **⚠️ Risks:**
  - Susceptible to **null session attacks** and **info leakage**.
  - Enables enumeration of shares, users, and OS details.
  - **Deprecated protocol** not suitable for modern environments.
- **✅ Recommendations:**
  - Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP if not required.
  - Use **firewalls** to limit access to trusted hosts.
  - Replace with SMBv2/3 and enforce **network segmentation**.

---

## 🔸 Port **445/tcp** — `microsoft-ds`

- **🧠 Description:** Server Message Block (SMB) over TCP/IP. Used for file sharing, remote login, and domain communication.
- **⚠️ Risks:**
  - Infamous for enabling **WannaCry**, **NotPetya**, and **EternalBlue** exploits.
  - Frequently used for **lateral movement**, **credential harvesting**, and **RCE**.
  - Exposing this port to the internet is extremely risky.
- **✅ Recommendations:**
  - **Disable SMBv1**, enable SMBv2 or v3 with encryption.
  - Block externally and restrict internally using **ACLs**.
  - Keep systems patched (especially **MS17-010**).

---

## 🔸 Port **902/tcp** — `iss-realsecure`

- **🧠 Description:** Used by VMware ESXi/Server for remote management and VM console access.
- **⚠️ Risks:**
  - If exposed, may allow attackers to interact with hypervisors or VMs.
  - Older versions may have **auth bypass**, **DoS**, or **open proxy** flaws.
- **✅ Recommendations:**
  - Restrict to **internal-only management networks**.
  - Ensure VMware software is **fully updated**.
  - Monitor and restrict access to known IPs via **firewalls or VPN**.

---

## 🔸 Port **912/tcp** — `apex-mesh` *(Uncommon/Custom Service)*

- **🧠 Description:** Likely a **custom** or **proprietary** service (possibly internal APEX Mesh system).
- **⚠️ Risks:**
  - Unknown services can harbor **undocumented vulnerabilities**.
  - Could expose **debug interfaces**, **admin consoles**, or **insecure APIs**.
- **✅ Recommendations:**
  - Investigate the application using this port.
  - If unused, **disable the service**.
  - Perform **manual testing** or **fuzzing** to identify security flaws.

---

## 🔸 Port **16992/tcp** — `amt-soap-http`

- **🧠 Description:** Intel Active Management Technology (AMT) used for out-of-band management via Intel vPro.
- **⚠️ Risks:**
  - Known for **critical vulnerabilities** like **CVE-2017-5689**.
  - Runs **below the OS**, allowing **stealthy backdoors** and persistence.
  - Often left **unsecured**, giving remote control over entire systems.
- **✅ Recommendations:**
  - Disable Intel AMT if not used (via **BIOS/UEFI**).
  - Require **TLS**, **authentication**, and **IP whitelisting**.
  - Monitor for traffic on port 16992 as a **threat indicator**.
